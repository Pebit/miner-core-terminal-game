# miner-core-terminal-game
This is a cool game I made for the Microsoft VisualStudio2022 terminal. It won't work on other terminals since it uses specific VisualStudio2022 commands in the code for mining delay.

In this game you're a novice miner in a new Minecraft-inspired world where you start from the top (forest) gathering sticks and grass off of the ground and slowly dig yourself down to the lowest layers of the world, where the greatest treasures lie.

As it stands now, the game is still in developpement, you can mine and sell and all the biomes are implemented with only the Forest being accessible. Biome availability depends on tool efficiency and the game doesn't yet have a crafting function implemented for new tools.

Plan to add:
-craft/buy function
-tool auto swap after break
-save function to save all player variables
-load function
-adding a shop (?)
-making it work outside of the VisualStudio 2022 terminal 
-visual interface and possibly a change in controls with event-based reprogramming (on key presses instead of the current version of entering commands)
